This updated algorithm now incorporates the requested risk management features and improvements. Here are the key additions and changes:

Drawdown Limits:

Added a max_drawdown parameter (set to 2% by default).
The check_drawdown() method monitors the account balance and stops trading if the drawdown limit is exceeded.


Risk Controls:

Implemented stop-loss and take-profit orders in the execute_trade() method.
Stop-loss is set at 1% below the entry price, and take-profit at 2% above (these are configurable).


Risk Parity:

Added a max_position_size parameter (set to 10% of the portfolio by default).
The manage_positions() method now calculates the maximum position size based on the current account equity.


Monitoring:

Added a monitor_performance() method that logs current equity, buying power, number of positions, and overall performance.
This method is called in each iteration of the main loop.


Improved Position Management:

Now uses Alpaca's API to get current positions, ensuring accuracy.
Sells entire positions when the signal turns bearish, reducing the number of day trades.


Enhanced Trade Execution:

Uses limit orders for entries to avoid slippage.
Implements both stop-loss and take-profit orders as soon as a position is opened.



To use this algorithm:

Install required libraries: pip install alpaca-trade-api pandas numpy
Replace API_KEY and API_SECRET with your Alpaca API credentials.
Adjust risk parameters (max_drawdown, stop_loss_pct, take_profit_pct, max_position_size) as needed.
Run the script to start the algorithm.

Important considerations:

This algorithm now has multiple layers of risk management: PDT compliance, drawdown limits, position size limits, and per-trade stop-loss and take-profit orders.
The performance monitoring allows you to track the algorithm's effectiveness over time.
The risk parity feature ensures that no single position can disproportionately affect your portfolio.
Remember that while these risk management features significantly improve the safety of the algorithm, no trading strategy is without risk.
Always paper trade extensively and consult with a financial advisor before using any algorithmic trading strategy with real money.

This implementation provides a solid foundation for a risk-managed, PDT-compliant trading algorithm suitable for smaller accounts. You can further refine it based on your specific risk tolerance and trading goals.
