Algorithm: DayTradingSignalGenerator

Input:
    - stockData: Array of stock data objects containing all provided metrics
    - volumeThreshold: Minimum volume ratio (Today/Avg 10 Day) to consider
    - priceChangeThreshold: Minimum % price change today to consider

Output:
    - tradingSignals: Array of objects containing stock symbols and their trading scores

Variables:
    - score: Float
    - bullishPatterns: Integer
    - bearishPatterns: Integer

Function CalculatePerformanceScore(fiveDayPerf, thirteenWeekPerf):
    return (fiveDayPerf * 0.7) + (thirteenWeekPerf * 0.3)

Function CountBullishPatterns(stock):
    return sum of all bullish pattern flags in stock data

Function CountBearishPatterns(stock):
    return sum of all bearish pattern flags in stock data

Begin:
    1. Initialize empty tradingSignals array

    2. For each stock in stockData:
        3. If stock['Volume (Today/Avg 10 Day)'] < volumeThreshold OR 
           abs(stock['% Price Change Today']) < priceChangeThreshold:
            Continue to next stock

        4. score = 0
        5. bullishPatterns = CountBullishPatterns(stock)
        6. bearishPatterns = CountBearishPatterns(stock)

        7. // Volume score (0-40 points)
        score += min(stock['Volume (Today/Avg 10 Day)'] * 10, 40)

        8. // Candlestick pattern score (0-30 points)
        score += (bullishPatterns * 10) - (bearishPatterns * 5)

        9. // Price change score (0-20 points)
        score += min(abs(stock['% Price Change Today']) * 2, 20)

        10. // Performance score (0-10 points)
        perfScore = CalculatePerformanceScore(stock['Price Performance (5 Days)'], 
                                              stock['Price Performance (13 Weeks)'])
        score += min(perfScore, 10)

        11. If score > 50 AND bullishPatterns > 0:
            12. Append {symbol: stock['Symbol'], score: score} to tradingSignals

    13. Sort tradingSignals by score in descending order

    14. Return top 5 entries from tradingSignals
